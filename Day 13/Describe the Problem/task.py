# # Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# #Divya
# # 1. What is the for loop doing?
# # FOR LOOP IS USED TO ITERATE UNTIL IT NOT REACH THE RANGE FROM 1 TO 20
# # 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# WHEN TOUR I == 20 THEN PRINT OUT AS 20
# # 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# I HERE SHOULD BE RANGE FROM 1 TO 20
